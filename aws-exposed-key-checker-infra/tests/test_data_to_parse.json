    "description": "Hello,We have become aware that the AWS access key AKA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I1, belonging to IAM User example.com@@abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx1, along with the corresponding secret key is publicly available online at https://github.com/testorg/test-project/blob/abcdefg123450572a58f802fa79f84321983d332/folder1/file.js.To protect your account, we have temporarily limited your ability to use some AWS services.To protect your account from unwanted activity, we have applied the \"AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV2\" AWS Managed Policy (\"Quarantine Policy\") to the IAM User [user_id]. The Quarantine Policy applied to the IAM User [user_id] protects your account by denying access to high risk actions like iam:CreateAccessKey and ec2:RunInstances. Please refer to tehe \"AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV2 Permissions\" [1] to review all of the actions denied by the policy.Please do not remove the Quarantine Policy before following the instructions below. However, in cases where the Quarantine Policy is causing production issues you may choose to detach the policy from the user. Only users with admin privileges or with access to iam:DetachUserPolicy may remove the policy. Refer to the IAM User Guide [2] on how to remove managed policies.As a security best practice, we recommend that you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) [3].Follow the instructions below to secure and restore your account:For more detailed instructions, please refer to the \u201cWhat do I do if I notice unauthorized activity in my AWS account?\u201d user guide [4].Step 1:If your application uses the exposed access key, you need to replace the key. To replace the key, first create a second key (at that point both keys will be active). Then, modify your application to use the new key.Next, disable (do not delete) the exposed key by clicking on the \u201cMake inactive\u201d option in the console. If there are any problems with your application, you can reactivate the exposed key. When your application is fully functional using the new key, please delete the exposed access key AKA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I1.To delete IAM User Keys, go to your AWS Management Console - Users [5].To delete Root User Keys, go to your AWS Management Console - Security Credential [6].Please note, only rotating and deleting the exposed key may not be sufficient to protect your account, see Step 2.Step 2: Check your CloudTrail log for unwanted activity.Check your account for any unwanted activity such as creation of unapproved IAM users, and/or associated passwords (login profile), access keys, policies, roles or temporary security credentials by checking your CloudTrail log, and immediately delete them.To delete IAM users, go to your AWS Management Console - Users [7].To delete policies, go to your AWS Management Console - Policies [8].To delete roles, go to your AWS Management Console - Roles [9].Please note, deleting IAM users may impact production workloads and should be done carefully.Step 3: Review your AWS account for any unwanted AWS usage.Check your account for any unwanted usage such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or EC2 Spot bids by logging into your AWS Management Console and reviewing each service page. You can also do this by checking the \"Bills\" page in the Billing console [10].Please keep in mind that unwanted usage can occur in any region and that your console displays only one region at a time. To switch regions, use the drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console.Step 4: You must respond to the existing Support Case or create a new one [11] to confirm completion of steps 1-3 in order to restore access to your account, prevent suspension, and apply for a billing adjustment, if applicable.If you need help completing the steps to secure your account, let us know through the Support Case where you can request a phone call or chat session for immediate assistance.If you believe that your account is secured and there is no unwanted access or usage, please contact us immediately via the Support Case to confirm this in writing.Any billing adjustment related to unwanted charges will be considered after the account is secured.[1] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV2$jsonEditor?section=permissions[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#remove-policies-console[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html[4] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/potential-account-compromise/[5] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users[6] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential[7] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users[8] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies[9] https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill[11] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/Sincerely,Amazon Web ServicesAmazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc.

    "description": "Hello,We have become aware that the AWS Access Key AKA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I6 , belonging to IAM User example-test-domain.org@@abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx6 , along with the corresponding Secret Key is publicly available online at https://github.com/testorg/test-project/blob/abcdefg123450572a58f802fa79f84321983d332/folder1/.aws/credentials. Your security is important to us and this exposure of your account\u2019s IAM credentials poses a security risk to your AWS account, could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity, and violates the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of our Services.To protect your account from excessive charges and unauthorized activity, we have applied the \"AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV2\" AWS Managed Policy (\"Quarantine Policy\") to the IAM User listed above. The Quarantine Policy applied to the User protects your account by denying access to high risk actions like iam:CreateAccessKey and ec2:RunInstances. You can view all the actions denied by the policy by going here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV2$jsonEditor?section=permissions.For your security, DO NOT remove the Quarantine Policy before following the instructions below. In cases where the Quarantine Policy is causing production issues you may detach the policy from the user. NOTE: Only users with admin privileges or with access to iam:DetachUserPolicy may remove the policy. For instructions on how to remove managed policies go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#remove-policies-console. In the event of the unauthorized use of your AWS account, we may, at our sole discretion, provide you with concessions. However, a failure to follow the instructions below may jeopardize your ability to receive a concession.FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO SECURE AND RESTORE YOUR ACCOUNT. More detailed instructions for each item can be found in the \u201cWhat do I do if I notice unauthorized activity in my AWS account?\u201d guide in AWS public documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/potential-account-compromise/ Step 1: Rotate and delete the exposed AWS Access Key AKA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I6. To delete IAM User Keys go to your AWS Management Console here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users. To delete Root User Keys go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential.If your application uses the exposed Access Key, you need to replace the Key. To replace the Key, first create a second Key (at that point both Keys will be active) and then modify your application to use the new Key.Then disable (but do not delete) the exposed Key by clicking on the \u201cMake inactive\u201d option in the console. If there are any problems with your application, you can reactivate the exposed Key. When your application is fully functional using the new Key, please delete the exposed Key.NOTE: Only rotating and deleting the exposed Key may not be sufficient to protect your account, see Step 2.We also recommend enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your AWS account for increased security. You can find more information here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html Step 2: Check your CloudTrail log for unsanctioned activity. Check your account for any unsanctioned activity such as creation of unauthorized IAM users and/or associated passwords (login profile), access keys, policies, roles or temporary security credentials by checking your CloudTrail log, and immediately delete them.NOTE: Deleting IAM users may impact production workloads and should be done carefully. Step 3: Review your AWS account for any unauthorized AWS usage.Check your account for any unauthorized usage such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions or EC2 Spot bids by logging into your AWS Management Console and reviewing each service page. You can also do this by checking the \"Bills\" page in the Billing console by going here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill Please keep in mind that unauthorized usage can occur in any region and that your console displays only one region at a time. To switch regions, use the drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console.Step 4: [IMPORTANT] You must respond to the existing Support Case or create a new one to confirm completion of the steps above in order to restore access to your account, prevent suspension, and apply for a billing adjustment, if applicable.

If you cannot find an existing Support Case, please create a new one by going here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/ If you need help completing the steps to secure your account, let us know through the Support Case. You can request a phone call or chat session for immediate assistance. If you believe that your account is secured and there is no unauthorized access or usage, please contact us immediately via the Support Case to confirm this in writing.
