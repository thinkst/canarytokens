Canarytokens
=============
by Thinkst Applied Research

Overview
--------
Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on your network.

If you have any issues please check out our FAQ over [here](https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/wiki#), or create an issue and we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

Deprecations
------------
* The Slack API Token is deprecated and it's no longer possible to create new ones. Old tokens will still work.

Installation
------------
We recommend [the Docker image installation process](https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens-docker).

Configuration
-------------

The Canarytokens server can use many different settings configurations. You can find them in `settings.py`. There are two
main settings files: `frontend.env` and `switchboard.env`.

The `frontend.env` contains the frontend process settings such as:
- CANARY_DOMAINS=mytesttokensdomain.com
- CANARY_NXDOMAINS=pdf.demo.canarytokens.net
- CANARY_AWSID_URL=<custom awsid url>
- CANARY_WEB_IMAGE_UPLOAD_PATH=/uploads
- CANARY_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<custom google maps api key>
- LOG_FILE=frontend.log

The `switchboard.env` contains the switchboard process settings such as:
- CANARY_MAILGUN_DOMAIN_NAME=<mailgun domain>
- CANARY_MAILGUN_API_KEY=
- CANARY_MANDRILL_API_KEY=
- CANARY_SENDGRID_API_KEY=
- CANARY_PUBLIC_IP=<instead of using a domain>
- CANARY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=<instead of using an IP>
- CANARY_ALERT_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
- CANARY_ALERT_EMAIL_FROM_DISPLAY="Canarytoken Mailer"
- CANARY_ALERT_EMAIL_SUBJECT="Alert"
- CANARY_MAX_ALERTS_PER_MINUTE=1000
- CANARY_SMTP_USERNAME=<smtp username>
- CANARY_SMTP_PASSWORD=<smtp password>
- CANARY_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
- CANARY_SMTP_PORT=587
- CANARY_WEB_IMAGE_UPLOAD_PATH=/uploads
- LOG_FILE=switchboard.log
- ERROR_LOG_WEBHOOK=<URI of a webhook you want Error Logs posted to>

Please note that when choosing which email provider you would like to use, you **MUST** only provide
information related to that provider. E.g. if you have `CANARY_MAILGUN_API_KEY` then you must remove the others such as
`CANARY_SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `CANARY_MANDRILL_API_KEY`.

If you are using Mailgun's European infrastructure for your Canarytokens Server, you will need to add `CANARY_MAILGUN_BASE_URL=https://api.eu.mailgun.net` to your `switchboard.env`. If you do not specify that,
we will use the regular url as 'https://api.mailgun.net' as the default.

Lastly, we have added the ability to specify your own AWSID lambda so that you may host your own. The setting is placed in
`frontend.env` under `CANARY_AWSID_URL`. If this value is not specified, it will use our default hosted lambda.

### Configuration of Outgoing SMTP
When configuring outgoing SMTP please consider the following:

Restrictions:
* no other provider like Mailgun or Sendgrid must be configured for this to work
* only supports StartTLS right now (you have to use the corresponding port)
* no anonymous SMTP is supported right now (you have to use a username/password to authenticate)

The following settings have to be configured in `switchboard.env` for SMTP to work:
* CANARY_SMTP_SERVER: the SMTP server
* CANARY_SMTP_PORT: the port number of the SMTP server (must be a StartTLS enabled port!)
* CANARY_SMTP_USERNAME: Username for the SMTP server (no anonymous SMTP supported right now)
* CANARY_SMTP_PASSWORD: the password that corresponds to the username

A complete example config in `switchboard.env` then looks like this:
```
CANARY_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.yourserver.com
CANARY_SMTP_PORT=587
CANARY_SMTP_USERNAME=<your smtp username>
CANARY_SMTP_PASSWORD=<your smtp password>
CANARY_ALERT_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=canary@yourdomain.com
CANARY_ALERT_EMAIL_SUBJECT="Canary Alert via SMTP"
```

### Alert throttling
By default, unless running in DEBUG mode, no more than 1 alert per unique calling IP per
minute is permitted.  Activity will still be recorded in the database, and visible in
the token management console, but alerts will not be generated (email and/or webhook).

This is tunable with the switchboard ENV variable `CANARY_MAX_ALERTS_PER_MINUTE`.
